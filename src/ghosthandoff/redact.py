"""Secret-shape redaction for free text quoted into the pack.

Marker lines, commit subjects, and report excerpts are quoted text from
the project. They can accidentally contain a credential. Every piece of
free text that lands in HANDOFF.md or handoff.json passes through
``redact_text`` first. Shapes only, conservative, stdlib ``re`` only.

Shape alignment (Oct 14, 2026, ecosystem seam fix, SEAM_FIX_REPORT.md):
the patterns below are aligned with GhostSlice's canonical secret
guard (``ghostslice.secrets_scan``). The AWS access-key pattern is the
canonical ``AKIA|ASIA`` form, so temporary session keys are redacted
too; the GitHub, OpenAI/Anthropic, and Slack patterns are the
canonical spellings; the context-gated AWS secret shape and the
password-in-URL shape are mirrored from the guard as well. Where this
redactor deliberately differs from the guard (no placeholder
allow-list, no PEM block handling, no high-entropy heuristic), the
reason is recorded in SEAM_FIX_REPORT.md; the standing rule here is
fail closed, because the input is quoted fragments, not whole files.
